#Description

    There are already a lot of softwares that can be used to perform genome wide association studies (GWAS) and genome prediction (GP) but 
some of them are not computationally efficient or difficulty to use. The objective of the project is to develop a versatile, efficient 
and easy-to-use tool for GWAS and GP. Genotype files in VCF format, commonly used in resequencing or TPED format are read in fragment. 
The efficient mixed-model implemented in GEMMA was improved. The algorithm, average information restricted maximum likelihood (AI-REML) 
used to estimate variance component was implemented in a more efficient way. Univariate and repeated-measured GWAS and genome prediction 
of additive and dominant effects can be performed easily.
